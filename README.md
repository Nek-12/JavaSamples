### Android_MovieViewer  
A project I made for the SkillBox course on Android (introduction to Android Dev)

### PageViewer  
A short app to test Java networking capabilities and Swing graphical library

### Module_Test 
A simple app for testing module system that I compiled by hand

And a couple of university lab works
